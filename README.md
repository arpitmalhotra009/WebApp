## Motivation

The thermodynamic investigation of Predicting full load electrical power output of a baseload power plant is important to maximize the profit from the available megawatt-hours. 
However, the analysis of a system by using thermodynamic approaches takes too much computational time and effort, and sometimes the result of this analysis might be unsatisfactory and unreliable due to many assumptions considered and nonlinear equations. 

Hence, Machine Learning Models can be employed in place of thermodynamic equations to perform system analysis

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load.
Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.
1.   Ambient Temperature (AT): This input variable is measured in whole degrees in Celsius as it varies between 1.81 degree C and 37.11 degree C.
2.   Atmospheric Pressure (AP): This input variable is measured in units of minibars with the range of 992.89–1033.30 mbar.
3.   Relative Humidity (RH): This variable is measured as a percentage from 25.56% to 100.16%.
4.   Vacuum (Exhaust Steam Pressure, V): This variable is measured in cm Hg with the range of 25.36–81.56 cm Hg.
5.   Full Load Electrical Power Output (PE): PE is used as a target variable in the dataset. It is measured in mega watt with the range of 420.26–495.76 MW.
